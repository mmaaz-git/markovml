NOTES ON JAN 5:
- it works!! I can add ML models, propagate bounds, add inequalities, specify feature space, etc.
- and, it gives the same results as the simple method
- many times faster than simple method (when presolve is disabled)

NOTES ON JAN 6:
- Gauss-Seidel implemented!
- added MLPRegressor and MLPClassifier
- created gurobi_ml_ext.py, which contains MLPClassifer implementation using my own softmax
- tried adding decision tree classifier. seems like you can just use the same method as decision tree regressor, I checked the source code of gurobi ml

NOTES ON JAN 14:
- added support for verbosity and other params
- refactored ml opt code by having a single registry
- added the rest of the ml models
- almost finished a significant refactoring of the code to the AbstractMarkov class

NOTES ON JAN 15:
- finished refactoring to AbstractMarkov
- added MarkovReach and MarkovHitting, and played around with them a bit
- added feasibility check

NOTES ON JAN 18:
- added DecisionRules model

NOTES ON JAN 19:
- created add_decision_rules_constr function, which encodes DecisionRules into gurobi ml

NOTES ON JAN 26:
- feasibility check is finally working
- finished writing tutorials and docs
